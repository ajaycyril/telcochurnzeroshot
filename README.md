## Deployment Options

### Quick Start with Hugging Face Spaces

This platform is deployed as a [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ajaycyril/telcochurnzeroshot) for immediate access without installation.

### Local Deployment

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Set Kaggle credentials for automatic dataset download
# Windows:
setx KAGGLE_USERNAME "<your-username>"
setx KAGGLE_KEY "<your-key>"

# Start the application
python app.py
```

### Enterprise Deployment Recommendations

For production environments:
- Deploy as containerized application (Docker) for scalability
- Implement scheduled retraining pipeline with model versioning
- Connect to enterprise data sources via configurable adapters
- Integrate with existing BI dashboards via REST API

## Advanced Configuration

For extending the platform's capabilities:
- Add new model types in `modeling.py`
- Customize feature engineering in `data.py`
- Enhance visualization options in `app.py`
- Configure explainability settings in `explain.py`
